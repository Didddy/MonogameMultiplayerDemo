# MonogameMultiplayerDemo
This project demonstrates a basic multiplayer client/server game using Monogame and several backends including LiteNetLib and Lidgren. It is intended to demonstrate some basic strategies for handling sessions, reliability, simple prediction, and shared state snapshots. It's not meant to be used in production code, but we know how that goes :)
