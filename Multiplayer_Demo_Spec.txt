Plan for Networking Demo:


    Create Server
    Create Client which connects to server
    Create Small script which launches multiple clients (4)

    Clients get assigned a userid / player number in the order that they connect 

    If time, we do a small lobby which launches when all players agree

    Server collects input and sends out snapshots to all clients of positions and actions taken 

    Client and Server use NetworkLib which allows us to swap out any of the 2-3 network libraries that we're testing 

    If time permitting, bullet hell Demo
        enemies come on screen spamming bullets in random patterns.
        Each player has 1 life or can shoot the enemies
        Last man standing wins. 
        Players have X number of bullets and can opt to kill each other or kill the enemies. 


    Server Startup on Port X

    Client. connect to server and register self. 
    Client sends 'ready to play'

    When server receives all ready to play, sends message to all players starting countdown 
    Server starts countdown internally.
    Clients all start countdown. 

    Server sends initial snapshot to all players. 

    Clients recv initial snapshot which has their position and position of all other players. 

    Clients begin moving/etc.
        Clients send updates to the server.

    Server processes updates and sends out snapshots to all players synchronizing. 

    Server tracks player stats (bullets, is player hit, position of enemy projectiles)

    Server sends Death Notice in snapshot for any players which died
